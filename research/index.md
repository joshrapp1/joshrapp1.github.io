## Robust Imaging in Strong Background Light

We introduce a new approach to depth and reflectivity estimation that emphasizes 
the unmixing of contributions from signal and noise sources. At each pixel in an image,
short-duration range gates are adaptively determined and applied to remove detections 
likely to be due to noise. For pixels with too few detections to perform this censoring accurately,
data are combined from neighboring pixels to improve depth estimates, 
where the neighborhood formation is also adaptive to scene content.
