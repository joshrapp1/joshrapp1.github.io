I was given an award for one of the best presentations at CGSW 3.0, which is the third annual 
Center for Information & Systems Engineering (CISE) Graduate Student Workshop.
CISE is a cross-disciplinary center that brings together researchers in areas of 
applied probability, information theory, machine learning, networking, signal processing, and more.
