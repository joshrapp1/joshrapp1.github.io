I'm so thrilled to have been award the 3rd place "Best Student Paper Award" 
at ICIP 2018 for my paper "Improving Lidar Depth Resolution with Dither."
This work demonstrates how subtractive dither can be applied to photon-
counting lidar to achieve higher-resolution depth images.
The same principles could be used in SPAD arrays to reduce the need for 
access to a high-resolution clock at each pixel.
