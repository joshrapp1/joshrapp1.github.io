I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.computationalimaging.org/) at Stanford University.
I received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from [Boston University](http://sites.bu.edu/goyal/) in 2020.
During my Ph.D., I was supported by a [Draper Fellowship](https://www.draper.com/careers/fellow-program). 
My research is focused on expanding the capabilities of single-photon lidar systems, 
from increasing acquisition speed, temporal resolution, and robustness to ambient light to seeing around corners.
