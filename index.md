I am currently a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Boston University, 
supported by a Draper Fellowship. 
My research is focused on expanding the capabilities of single-photon lidar systems, 
from increasing acquisition speed, temporal resolution, and robustness to ambient light to seeing around corners.
